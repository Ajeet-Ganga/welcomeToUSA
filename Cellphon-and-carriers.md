# Cellphone and Carriers #

- It is generally accepted that [Verizon] and [AT&T] have best network coverage, but [T-Mobile] and [Sprint] have better pricing.
- If you are not planning on leaving city centers, then T-Mobile is preferred.
- If you think you might travel a lot, don't go for T-Mobile as it will not have coverage on the way or in rural area.
- Between AT&T and Verizon, if you don’t already have a GSM/CDMA phone, then Verizon is slightly preferred.
- If you are choosy one then do explore other providers: Boost Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Brightspot Mobile, Metro PCS, Ting and Consumer Cellular.
- _I have T-mobile family plan._

### Family Plans
  - [T-Mobile] offers a family plan (some others too), where multiple people can form a family (don't have to *be* a family) to avail group discount.
  - The one disadvantage of this is, combined billing for family.
  - The advantage is 20% to 35% discounts.



## Current best plan IMO

### T-Mobile (GSM phones)
- Cost per line $40
- Unlimited talk/text/data
	+ Reduced speed after 30GB
