# Banking

- Broadly speaking, there are two types of banks, credit unions and commercial banks.
- Credit unions are not-for-profit banking unions which are are little more friendly and definately with better customer service.
- Commercials banks may have more more branches but they will try to charge a small fees for every convinience.
- _I have one account in credit union ([FirstTech]) and one in [Chase]_
- Some of the big commercial banks of USA include [Chase], [Bank of America], [Wells Fargo]
- Credit unions are usually localized, so you will have to search for the most popular credit union in your city/state.
  - Note that even though your specific credit union (e.g.[FirstTech]) is local, you can bank at other credit unions branches usually without extra charges.

## Opening an account
- SSN and Passport with valid VISA should be sufficient to open a bank account.

## Banking safety
- Most (not all) of the the bank accounts are [federally insured], for about $250k per depositor per bank.
- For online banking, Two-factor-authentication, is extremely recommended.
  - If an online banking portal, doesn't support [Two-factor-authentication], then don't use that portal.
