# Banking

- Broadly speaking, there are two types of banks, credit unions and commercial banks.
- Credit unions are not-for-profit banking unions which are are little more friendly and definately with better customer service.
- Commercials banks may have more more branches but they will try to charge a small fees for every convinience.
- _I have one account in credit union ([FirstTech]) and one in [Chase]_
- Some of the big commercial banks of USA include [Chase], [Bank of America], [Wells Fargo]
- Credit unions are usually localized, so you will have to search for the most popular credit union in your city/state.
  - Note that even though your specific credit union (e.g.[FirstTech]) is local, you can bank at other credit unions branches usually without extra charges.

## Opening an account
- SSN and Passport with valid VISA should be sufficient to open a bank account.

## Banking safety
- Most (not all) of the the bank accounts are [federally insured], for about $250k per depositor per bank.
- For online banking, Two-factor-authentication, is extremely recommended.
  - If an online banking portal, doesn't support [Two-factor-authentication], then don't use that portal.
## Account types
- There are basically three types of account  checking, saving and CD.
- CD account is equivalent fixed-deposit account of India, where you can't withdraw money without penalty or interest forfature or both.
- If you do not care how much interest you are earning on your money sitting in bank, then checking is equivalent to saving in most of the modern banks.
- Checking accounts either do not pay interest or pay about tenth of interest rate of saving account.
- Saving account pay higher interest, but may not be free.
  + Some banks would require a minimum balance (about $10,000) or monthly direct deposit (of your salary, scholorship et cetra)
- Many banks pay handsome to open an account with them between $200 to $600.
  - You can search and buy such coupons [online on Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_sacat=0&_nkw=chase+%24300+coupon&_frs=1)
  - *It is perfectly legal to buy these coupons and redeem them.*
    + I am not a lawyer but I have been told by bank that they do not care from where you get the coupon. 
### What do I do exactly ?
- You usually open one saving a/c and one checking a/c. Keep your majority of balance in saving account and transfer one month's worth expense to your checking a/c.
- The general pattern is to have a saving account with direct deposit and have a checking account linked to your debit card/checks for every day activities. 
- There is limit of 6 online transfers between accounts.
- Keep atleast 10 check leaves handy. There are many occasions (rent and large purchases), where they accept only checks.
- Almost all banks have heavy penalty for overdraft and bounced checks. _These charges are heavy(~ $100)._
